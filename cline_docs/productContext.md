## Product Context

**Project Purpose and Goals:**
The goal of this project is to create an MCP server that can interact with an inference platform (Cerebras AI) to execute user tasks. The project will utilize an orchestrator module to manage worker modules for parallel processing of sub-tasks.

**Core User Problems/Solutions:**
- Problem: Users need a way to easily submit tasks to powerful inference platforms.
- Solution: Provide an MCP server that abstracts the complexity of interacting with the inference platform.
- Problem: Large, complex tasks can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to process on a single system.
- Solution: Implement an orchestrator module to divide tasks and distribute the workload across multiple worker modules for parallel processing.

**Key Workflows:**
1. User submits a task to the MCP server.
2. Cline (the MCP server) analyzes the user's request and breaks it down into smaller, well-defined tasks suitable for the orchestrator.
3. The orchestrator module receives the list of tasks from Cline.
4. The orchestrator spawns multiple worker modules.
5. Each worker module processes its assigned task and outputs the result to an individual file.
6. The orchestrator monitors the worker modules and collects the results from their output files.
7. The orchestrator hands the individual results back to Cline.
8. Cline compiles the results from the orchestrator into a finished product.
9. The MCP server returns the compiled result to the user.

**Product Priorities:**
1. Reliable task submission and response retrieval.
2. Implementation of the orchestrator and worker module architecture.
3. Efficient task decomposition by Cline and distribution by the orchestrator.
4. Seamless result aggregation and compilation by Cline.
5. Handling of token limits and multi-turn conversations (future).
6. Clear error handling and logging.
