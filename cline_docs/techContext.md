## Technical Context

**Core Technologies and Frameworks:**
- **MCP SDK:** Used for building the MCP server and defining tools and resources.
- **TypeScript:** Primary programming language for the server and potentially for the orchestrator and worker modules.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for the server and potentially for the orchestrator and worker modules.
- **axios:** HTTP client for making requests to the Cerebras AI API.
- **dotenv:** For managing environment variables.
- **(Potential) Child Processes/Worker Threads:** For implementing the orchestrator and worker module architecture. Node.js provides built-in modules for managing child processes and worker threads, which could be suitable for this purpose.
- **(Potential) Message Queues (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ):** For inter-process communication between the orchestrator and worker modules, especially if they are running as separate processes.
- **(Potential) File System:** For simple communication where worker modules write results to files that the orchestrator then reads.

**Integration Patterns:**
- The server integrates with the Cerebras AI API using RESTful API calls over HTTPS.
- MCP integration is handled by the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- The orchestrator will integrate with worker modules using inter-process communication mechanisms (e.g., message passing, shared files).

**Technical Constraints:**
- The Cerebras AI API has token limits for input prompts.
- The MCP server operates in a non-interactive environment.
- Considerations for managing and monitoring multiple worker processes.
- Ensuring efficient data transfer and synchronization between the orchestrator and workers.

**Development Environment:**
- The server and modules are developed using standard JavaScript/TypeScript tooling.
- Environment variables are used for configuration (e.g., API keys, worker configurations).
