## Progress

**Current capabilities:**
- Can define MCP server with tools.
- Can modify MCP server code.
- Can restart MCP server.
- Renamed the inference orchestrator MCP server to inference worker.
- Created and updated documentation files in `cline_docs`: `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md` to reflect the new project scope with the orchestrator and worker modules and to clarify the roles of Cline and the orchestrator.
- Defined the high-level architecture and technical considerations for the orchestrator and worker modules.
- Updated memory bank.

**Pending features:**
- Implement Cline's task decomposition logic.
- Design and implement the communication interface between Cline and the orchestrator.
- Implement the orchestrator module for task and worker management.
- Implement the worker modules for processing sub-tasks.
- Establish communication between the orchestrator and worker modules.
- Successfully call the `submit_task` tool, potentially leveraging the orchestrator for complex tasks.
- Communicate with the inference platform.
- Audit the output.

**Progress estimate:** 25%
