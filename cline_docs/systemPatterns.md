## System Patterns

**High-Level Architecture:**
The system consists of an MCP server (Cline) that acts as an intermediary between the user and the Cerebras AI inference platform. Cline incorporates an orchestrator module responsible for managing worker modules for parallel processing of sub-tasks.

**Technical Patterns and Data Flow:**
1. The user interacts with the MCP system, calling a tool (e.g., `submit_task`).
2. The MCP SDK forwards the request to Cline (the MCP server).
3. Cline receives the user's request and analyzes it to break it down into smaller, well-defined tasks suitable for the orchestrator.
4. If orchestration is needed:
    a. Cline provides the list of sub-tasks to the orchestrator module.
    b. The orchestrator spawns and manages worker modules.
    c. Each worker module processes an assigned sub-task and outputs the result to a file.
    d. The orchestrator collects the results from the worker modules' output files.
    e. The orchestrator hands the individual results back to Cline.
    f. Cline compiles the results from the orchestrator into a final response.
    g. Cline sends the final response back to the MCP client.
5. If orchestration is not needed, Cline directly forwards the task to the Cerebras AI API.
6. The Cerebras AI API processes the task and returns a response.
7. Cline receives the response and sends it back to the MCP client.

**Orchestrator Module:**
- Responsible for receiving a list of well-defined tasks from Cline and managing worker modules to execute them.
- Will implement strategies for efficiently distributing tasks to workers.
- Needs a mechanism for spawning and monitoring worker modules.
- Will collect results from worker modules and provide them back to Cline.

**Worker Modules:**
- Independent processes responsible for processing individual, well-defined tasks received from the orchestrator.
- Will receive specific tasks from the orchestrator.
- Will output results to individual files.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Using the MCP framework for exposing inference capabilities.
- Implementing an orchestrator module for parallel task processing, managed by Cline.
- Utilizing worker modules for executing sub-tasks.
- Choosing a suitable inter-process communication method (to be determined) between the orchestrator and workers.
- Using the Cerebras AI API for inference.
- Implementing task validation and error handling within Cline and the modules.

**Operational Patterns and Error Handling:**
- Cline and the orchestrator will log all key operations and module interactions.
- Errors during task decomposition or worker processing will be handled by the orchestrator and reported back to Cline.
- Errors from the Cerebras AI API will be caught and returned to the user with informative messages by Cline.
- Cline checks for API key configuration and warns if it's missing.
